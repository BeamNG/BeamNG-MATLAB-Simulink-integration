Simulink Bridge allows co-simulation between tightly coupled systems.
`Tightly-coupled <https://documentation.beamng.com/beamng_tech/cosimulationeditor/tight_coupling/>`_ systems involve two processes running simultaneously and interacting with each other in a dependent way. This involves one side sending data to the other process and vice versa, on a regular cycle. BeamNG can be coupled to a third party (such as Simulink) in this manner. These sections outlines some considerations which the user should understand when attempting co-simulation with BeamNG.tech.
