## Getting Started with MATLAB bridge 

We have developed 5 fundamental scripts that showcase the versatility of using the MATLAB bridge to launch the BeamNG.tech simulator. These scripts demonstrate various capabilities such as utilizing sensors, creating scenarios, capturing screenshots from multiple viewpoints, analyzing movements, and visualizing sensors including lidar, depth camera, and AI driving for the vehicle.

### 1. Vehicle State Plot
Use the state sensor to plot some graphs of the vehicle position, wheel speed and direction, throttle, and brake.

### 2. Running Lidar sensor, and AI control. 
Create a simple scenario and use the simulator's AI with BeamNGpy.

### 3. Multi-shot Camera    
Change the position and rotation of a camera.

### 4. Object Placement    
Define a custom scenario for a given map and generate procedural content, i.e. simple meshes.

### 5. Annotation and Bounding Boxes
Get semantic annotations, instance annotations, and draw bounding boxes (note that this feature is not ready for use yet).
