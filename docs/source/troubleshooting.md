# Troubleshooting

This section lists common issues with this toolbox. Since this
toolbox is closely tied to BeamNG.tech, it is also recommended to consult the [support in documentation website](https://documentation.beamng.com/support/troubleshooter/#bng-adventure:/start/techstart) on BeamNG.tech

## Toolbox not visible

**Problem**: You cannot see the toolbox in your Simulink library browser, or running the `beamng` command does not work.

**Solution**: You may have to add the toolbox path to MATLAB search path. Try the following steps:
1. Re-start MATLAB and check if the `beamng` command works now.
2. If this does not work, try to [install](installation.md#install-beamngtech-support-for-matlab-and-simulink) the toolbox again (you probably have to [uninstall](installation.md#uninstall) the toolbox first).
