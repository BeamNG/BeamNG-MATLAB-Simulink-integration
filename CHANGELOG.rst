Version 0.1.0
=============
- Basic prototype UDP tight-coupling system for Simulink model with the BeamNG simulator. This prototype solution demonstrates typical communication between both ends of the system.

Example #1:
The user is able to test a basic controller to maintain the speed limit at using pedals of the vehicle. The speed limit can be edited speed_input constant as shown in Figure 9. Switching the vehicle control from torque to pedal by the toggle switch at the bottom of the model.

Example #2:
The user is able to test a basic controller to maintain the speed limit using only the wheel torque. User can switch from the torque control by using the toggle switch at the bottom of the model in Figure 9.

Example #3:
The user is able to test a basic controller to maintain an angle of the vehicle in the map using Desired_steering_angle_input constant as shown in Figure 9. switching the vehicle control from torque to pedal by the toggle switch at the bottom of the model.
