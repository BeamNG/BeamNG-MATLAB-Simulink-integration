- We have developed Five fundamental scripts that showcase the versatility of using the MATLAB bridge to launch the Beamng.Tech simulator. 
- the Five scripts are: 
    - annotation_bounding_boxes.m
    - lidar_tour.m
    - lidar_tour.m
    - multishot_camera.m
    - object_placement.m
    - vehicle_state_plotting.m

    - Basic prototype UDP tight-coupling system for Simulink model with the BeamNG simulator. This prototype solution demonstrates typical communication between both ends of the system.
