%% Simulink Interface
% This document provides details and contains instructions for 
% using the prototype UDP tight-coupling system for Simulink 
% model with the BeamNG simulator. 
% This prototype solution demonstrates typical communication 
% between both ends of the system.

%% BeamNG Architecture Considerations
% BeamNG operates within a multi-threaded architecture. 
% Graphics rendering, collision detection, UI etc. 
% all run on separate threads. 
% Also running on its own thread are the physics computations.
%
% Wall-clock time refers to the time which has passed in the real world. 
% Simulation time refers to the the amount of time which has been simulated; 
% note that we can simulate ahead in time, 
% so the current simulation time could ahead of the current wall clock time.
%
% *BeamNG has both graphics steps (frames) and physics steps*:
%
% Frames describe how often the user receives a visual update on screen, 
% and can be measured in Frames-per-Second (FPS). 
% Eg for 30 FPS, we update the image on screen 30 times every second. 
% This quantity varies a lot of time, but is guaranteed not to drop below 20 FPS at any time.
%
% At the start of a frame, predictions are made as to when the next frame is expected in (wall-clock time). 
% Within each frame, BeamNG computes enough physics steps to take the simulation time 
% up to this predicted wall-clock time, at which time the next frame will start to execute.
%
% Each physics step computes exactly 0.5ms of simulation time. 
% This quantity is fixed, and can also be expressed as 2000hz. 
% Within any frame, BeamNG knows how many physics steps it must compute to take the simulation time
% up to the next frame start time (predicted). 
% However, there is no guarantee as to when – inside the current frame – 
% these steps will be computed; only that they must be computed ahead of wall-clock time, 
% in order to keep the simulation real-time.
%
% <<pictures/1_BeamNG_Multithreading.png>>
%
% This pictures shows a simplified overview of this, 
% where the physics steps are shown to be running concurrently with various other processes.
% In particular in this picutre two cases are hilighted:
%
% * In frame 1 (left), we have the case where the physics steps are computed earlier than 
%   the work being performed on the other concurrent threads. 
%   This results in a gap on the physics thread towards the end of the frame. 
%   The other threads are the frame bottleneck here, not the physics.
% * In frame 2 (right), we have the second case where the other threads finish earlier than 
%   the physics steps; we say here that the physics steps are the frame bottleneck.
%
% A main thing to note here, particularly when looking over multiple frames, 
% is the irregular nature of when physics steps occur. 
% We cannot predict when future physics steps will be, 
% since this depends on many non-deterministic factors (especially within Human-In-The-Loop environments). 
% Further, depending on what needs to be computed, some physics steps can take longer than others to compute.
%
% However, we can guarantee a fixed number of physics steps being performed on average, 
% over reasonable lengths of time. This is important to note, especially since we are typically 
% simulating ahead of time.

%% Execution
%
% In order to execute efficient coupling, the user must provide accurate measurements for two things:
% 
% * *The Simulink computation time*: 
%   This is the time required for Simulink to process a message sent to it from BeamNG. 
%   If this varies, then the user could choose either the maximum or the average time and see which provides more optimal results. 
%   If it is regular, more optimal coupling can be made between the two.
%   The |simulinkTime| property in the BeamNG controller should be set to this time.
% * *The UDP round-trip time*:
%   This is the time required for the UDP infrastructure to send a message from the BeamNG machine to the Simulink machine, and back again. 
%   Even if they are on the same machine, this should still be measured.
%   A standard ping test from a terminal is sufficient for this. For example, on windows:
%   
%  Type "cmd" to bring up the Command Prompt.
%  Open the Command Prompt.
%  Type "ping" in the black box and hit the space bar.
%  Type the IP address you'd like to ping (e.g., 192.XXX.X.X).
%  Review the ping results displayed.
%  When this value has been computed, the pingTime property in the BeamNG controller should be set to this.
%
% *V-Sync*: 
% The user should ensure that the V-Sync mode is switched off in BeamNG. 
% If it is switched on, optimal coupling will not be achieved since V-Sync will add extra latency. 
% This option can be found in the Display menu on the main options screen (press ESC).
